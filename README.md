# Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing global YouTube statistics to extract meaningful insights and trends. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and visualization techniques to understand and interpret the data effectively.

# Project Structure
## Data Overview
Initial inspection and understanding of the dataset structure.

## Descriptive Statistics
Summarizing the data through key metrics and visualizations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identifying trends and relationships within the data using visual and statistical tools.

## Statistical Testing
Conducting hypothesis tests to assess significant differences and relationships within the data.

## Visualization
Generating informative plots to represent data distribution, correlations, and trends.

# Key Tools and Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scipy**: For statistical tests and analyses.

# Project Highlights
- Comprehensive descriptive statistics of the dataset.
- In-depth EDA to uncover patterns and insights.
- Hypothesis testing, including t-tests and chi-square tests, to explore relationships and validate findings.
- Clear visual representations of data trends and comparisons.
  
# How to Use

This section will guide you through setting up and running the YouTube Statistics Data Analysis Project.

## Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Analasys-Project.git
```

## Navigating to the Project Directory
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Data-Analasys-Project
```

## Installing Required Libraries
Ensure all required libraries are installed. You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Opening the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook to start the analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook Youtube_statistics_data_analysis_proj.ipynb
```

## Running the Notebook
Run the notebook by clicking the **"Run All"** button to execute all cells sequentially. This will process the data and generate visualizations, tables, and statistical results.

## Data Placement
Ensure that the dataset `Global YouTube Statistics.csv` is located in the `data` folder (this file should be included in the repository by default).

# Expected Outputs
- Descriptive statistics summarizing key metrics of the dataset.
- Multiple visualizations illustrating data distributions, trends, and correlations.
- Results from statistical tests such as t-tests and chi-square tests.
